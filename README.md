# game-of-life

A game of life html page powered by Vue components.

Made with [the Vue webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).

Just check [the github page ](https://sergeon.github.io/vue-components-game-of-life/) with the game. So cool :-D!

Those kind of things should be made with canvas. This is just a project to explore [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
